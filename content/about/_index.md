I'm Neal, an [engineering leader](../categories/management/) focused on building software that helps people work with data. As a leader, I've managed small teams, scaled them up gradually to larger organizations, and navigated startup hypergrowth. I enjoy growing happy, high-performing teams, mentoring new leaders, and generally creating the conditions to ship great products.

I am [passionate](../talks/) about open source. It's a great way to do work that has a broad impact, and I find that fostering inclusive, sustainable developer communities--while hard work--is a source of joy. I'm a member of the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) Project Management Committee ([PMC](https://arrow.apache.org/committers/)) and for several years maintained the [`arrow` R package](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/). I maintain a handful of other R [packages](../r/) and, for better or worse, am not afraid to mangle code in other languages, too. 

Standard disclaimer: posts here do not reflect the opinions of any employer or other group I am associated with, and any resemblence to particular individuals or entities is coincidental unless explicitly stated otherwise. I'm just an organic language model [hallucinating a stream of words](../) in response to a given topic.
