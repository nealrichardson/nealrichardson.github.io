I maintain several R packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and have others on [GitHub](https://github.com/nealrichardson). For several years, I was the maintainer of the [`arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/) package. 

Some packages with documentation sites published here:

-   [`distro`](/distro/): A Standardized Interface to Linux Distribution Version Information

-   [`httpcache`](/r/httpcache/): Query Cache for HTTP Clients

-   [`httptest`](/r/httptest/) (for `httr`) and [`httptest2`](/httptest2/) (for `httr2`): A Test Environment for HTTP Requests
