In putting up the [slides for the talk I gave at last week's Bay Area R meetup](/talks/api-in-r/), I figured it would be good to dig up the slides from previous talks and post them here too. (In fact, I linked to one of them in the slides from last week.) So, there's now a ["Talks"](/talks/) section of the site.
