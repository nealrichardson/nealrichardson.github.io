The 3.2.0 release of [`httptest`](https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/) is now on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httptest). This is a minor release with several enhancements suggested by package users. Details can be found in the [release notes](https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/news/#httptest-3-2-0).

A few of the changes improve the behavior of `httptest` in interactive use. There is one new function, [`use_httptest()`](https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/reference/use_httptest.html), which configures your package to use `httptest` when you're setting it up.

Thanks to everyone who filed issues and submitted pull requests. Included in this release are contributions from and improvements prompted by GitHub users `brooklynbagel`, `jameslamb`, `jjankowiak`, `npelikan`, and `ramiromagno`.
