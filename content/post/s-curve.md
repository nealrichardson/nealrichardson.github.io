The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake exposed many structural weaknesses across the Bay Area. Chief among them was the seismic stability of the Bay Bridge, connecting San Francisco and Oakland. The eastern span was supported on pillars that did not go all the way down to bedrock, and they suffered from the liquefaction of the sea floor, famously collapsing in a few places. It clearly needed to be replaced before the next Big One hit.

How do you replace a bridge that hundreds of thousands of vehicles cross daily without completely disrupting everything? Very carefully. Building the new bridge next to the old one is the easy part. The hard parts are how to connect to the anchorages on each side (Oakland on one, the tunnel through Yerba Buena Island on the other) and have the resulting new bridge have a natural traffic flow---no hard turns to drive around what used to be the old bridge.

One notable step in the process was the addition of the "S Curve". In the summer of 2009, workers constructed a structure next to the connection between the eastern span and Yerba Buena Island. The new structure would bend the flow of traffic out to the south (the S curve) so that the new bridge could make a natural approach to the tunnel, and provide the points where the new bridge would connect. Over Labor Day weekend, Caltrans closed the bridge, demolished the old section of bridge, and literally slid the new structure into place. For four years, drivers passed over this S Curve, until the new bridge opened. Then the S was demolished.

In short, in order to replace a large, heavily-used structure, you often need to build a lot of complex, unnatural, and clever things along the way---temporary structures you'll throw away. It's not the same as designing and implementing the structure from nothing. Building a bridge and replacing a bridge are quite different processes, even though they involve the same laws of physics and principles of structural engineering.

Of course, this is true not only of bridge building. Life in general is nonlinear.



Lots of wrangling over design, cost, constraints, delays, cost overruns, panic from above stopping work, etc.

Plus accident on S Curve, needed safety features added, more temporary work.
