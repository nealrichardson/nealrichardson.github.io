-   [Scaling Up Data Workflows with Arrow, Parquet, and DuckDB](/user-2025/): How Parquet files, partitioning, and query engines like DuckDB and the one in the [`arrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r) R package can help you scale up your data workflows in R. Presented at the [useR! 2025 Conference](https://user2025.r-project.org/), August 2025.

-   [Solving Big Data Problems With Apache Arrow](/talks/user-2021/) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e7W4ktjASQ)): Some applications of the `arrow` R package provided by the user community. Presented at the [useR! 2021 Conference](https://user2021.r-project.org/), July 2021.

-   [Bigger Data With Ease Using Apache Arrow](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/bigger-data-with-ease-using-apache-arrow/) ([video](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/bigger-data-with-ease-using-apache-arrow/)): This talk examines the unique characteristics of the Arrow project that enable it to redefine what is possible in R. It also highlights some of the latest developments in the `arrow` R package, including how you can query and manipulate multi-file datasets, and it presents strategies for speeding up workflows by up to 100x. Presented at rstudio::global(2021) conference, January 2021.

Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software for Science Meeting, December 2020.

-   [Fast Data Access in R and Python With Apache Arrow](/talks/odsc-west-2020/): Review latest features in the 2.0.0 release of Apache Arrow and build up to an example of using the Flight RPC framework to ship data.

-   [Publishing an R Package Repository with Public (Free!) Services](/talks/r-pkg-repo/):
With just a couple of additional scripts, you can use Travis-CI and Appveyor to publish binary R packages to a repository hosted on Bintray that lets your users install the latest version of your package with `install.packages()`, all for free. August 2019.

-   [Wrapping Web APIs in R](/talks/api-in-r/): How packaging and testing can allow you to spend less time dealing with the API and more time working with data in R. Highlights the use of the [`httptest`](/r/httptest/) and [`skeletor`](/r/skeletor/) packages.
