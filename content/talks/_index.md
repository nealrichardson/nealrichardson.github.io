Here are the slides from a few talks I've given in recent years:

-   [Wrapping Web APIs in R](/talks/api-in-r/): How packaging and testing can allow you to spend less time dealing with the API and more time working with data in R. Highlights the use of the [`httptest`](/r/httptest/) and [`skeletor`](/r/skeletor/) packages. Talk given at the [Bay Area R User Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/R-Users/events/252169561) August 2018 meeting.

-   [Dr. Datascience, Or: How I Learned to Stop Munging and Love Tests](/talks/testing/): Lessons from test-driven development (TDD) for data scientists. Lecture given at the 2016 [Big Dive](http://bigdive.eu/) data science workshop in Turin, IT. This talk is a revised version of the one Mike Malecki and I gave at the 2016 [New York R Conference](https://rstats.nyc/2016/).
