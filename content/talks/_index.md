-   [Accelerating Analytics With Apache Arrow](/talks/rstudio-conf-2020/):
What [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) is,

and how you can get involved. Talk given at rstudio::conf(2020), San Francisco.

-   [Publishing an R Package Repository with Public (Free!) Services](/talks/r-pkg-repo/):
With just a couple of additional scripts, you can use Travis-CI and Appveyor to publish binary R packages to a repository hosted on Bintray that lets your users install the latest version of your package with `install.packages()`, all for free. August 2019.

-   [Wrapping Web APIs in R](/talks/api-in-r/): How packaging and testing can allow you to spend less time dealing with the API and more time working with data in R. Highlights the use of the [`httptest`](/r/httptest/) and [`skeletor`](/r/skeletor/) packages. Talk given at the [Bay Area R User Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/R-Users/events/252169561) August 2018 meeting.
