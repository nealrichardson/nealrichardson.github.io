      <title>Should You Add a Package Dependency?</title>

      <description>At Crunch, we’ve recently hired an “R Team” to build out our package offerings beyond what I could write in my spare time. It’s been great to have more resources to dedicate to our R tools, and it’s been particularly fun for me because now I get to have package design debates with other smart humans, not just inside my head.
In one such debate, we discussed when it was appropriate to add a new dependency to a package.</description>

      <title>Better Management Through Code</title>

      <description>At Crunch, I lead both engineering and product management. Over the last few years, what that entails has changed greatly. How I spent my day when we were getting started, with a team of four developers and zero users, is very different from how I spend my time now with 16 on the team and thousands of users around the world. In fact, my day-to-day has evolved through several phases as we&amp;rsquo;ve grown, and each phase has come with its own challenges and learning opportunities—or rather, challenges that are learning opportunities.</description>

      <title>7 Hard Testing Problems Made Easy By httptest</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of testing and test automation, both on the team I lead and in my own projects. Tests provide valuable evidence that your code works. Without tests, you&amp;rsquo;re engaging in faith-based development: you believe your code works because you believe in your own infallibility as a coder. Theology aside, as a practical matter, tests are liberating because they allow you to modify and extend your code without fear of breaking existing functionality.</description>

      <title>Building a Blogdown Site with Travis-CI</title>

      <description>Over on the Crunch.io dev blog, I wrote about how we used Travis-CI to automate the building of our various static sites. I thought I’d do the same for my personal blog, though with one twist: using R and the blogdown package on top of Hugo.
This blogdown GitHub issue pointed to Yihui’s guide to building bookdown projects on Travis, as well as a project that had adapted that flow for blogdown.</description>
