&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a great start, but why stop there? If you have a personal website or blog, it would be nice to have your package page mesh with it&amp;mdash;that is, it should fit with your &amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo;. Your personal site has a style (font, color, layout, etc.), and ideally your pkgdown site should match it. If you have a custom domain name for your website, it would be great to serve your pkgdown site under the same domain, rather than the default &lt;code>username.github.io/pkgname&lt;/code> GitHub Pages convention. And if you have more than one R package with a website, they should all have a coherent presentation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Blogdown Site with Travis-CI</title><link>/2017/06/01/building-a-blogdown-site-with-travis-ci/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 21:49:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>/2017/06/01/building-a-blogdown-site-with-travis-ci/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://crunch.io/dev/blog/building-the-blog-on-travis/">Over on the Crunch.io dev blog&lt;/a>, I wrote about how we used Travis-CI to automate the building of our various static sites. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do the same for my personal blog, though with one twist: using R and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown&lt;/a> package on top of Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/26">This blogdown GitHub issue&lt;/a> pointed to &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/github.html">Yihui&amp;rsquo;s guide to building bookdown projects on Travis&lt;/a>, as well as a project that had &lt;a href="https://github.com/curso-r/verao2017">adapted&lt;/a> that flow for &lt;code>blogdown&lt;/code>. Both were helpful, and with my prior experience, I was able to build on those examples to come up with a simple workflow. It was shockingly straightforward.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
