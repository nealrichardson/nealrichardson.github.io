      <description>Publishing a website for your R package is simple with pkgdown. As I recently discussed, you can build a basic site and host it on GitHub Pages with just a handful of commands and clicks.
That&amp;rsquo;s a great start, but why stop there? If you have a personal website or blog, it would be nice to have your package page mesh with it&amp;mdash;that is, it should fit with your &amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Building a Blogdown Site with Travis-CI</title>

      <description>Over on the Crunch.io dev blog, I wrote about how we used Travis-CI to automate the building of our various static sites. I thought I’d do the same for my personal blog, though with one twist: using R and the blogdown package on top of Hugo.
This blogdown GitHub issue pointed to Yihui’s guide to building bookdown projects on Travis, as well as a project that had adapted that flow for blogdown.</description>
