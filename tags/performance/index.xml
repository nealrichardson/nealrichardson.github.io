I suspected there were some misconceptions about the frequency of certain kinds of requests, and that some basic descriptive statistics could help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whenever I start an analysis like this, I also think about how to make it easier to repeat it. If the question is interesting enough to merit analysis now, it will probably be interesting next month too&amp;mdash;particularly if it reveals things we want to improve. In this particular exercise, not only did I get statistics for my presentation, I also got a &lt;a href="https://github.com/nealrichardson/elbr">new R package&lt;/a> and some insights into how to read in data stored in lots of text files in an efficient, fast way, using &lt;a href="http://readr.tidyverse.org/">&lt;code>readr&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
