      <description>Publishing a website for your R package is simple with pkgdown. As I recently discussed, you can build a basic site and host it on GitHub Pages with just a handful of commands and clicks.
That&amp;rsquo;s a great start, but why stop there? If you have a personal website or blog, it would be nice to have your package page mesh with it&amp;mdash;that is, it should fit with your &amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>pkgdown is an incredibly powerful tool for building beautiful websites for R packages. With pkgdown and services like GitHub Pages, deploying a package website is so simple and straightforward that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see it as an essential part of writing a package.
