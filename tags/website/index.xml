      <description>pkgdown is an incredibly powerful tool for building beautiful websites for R packages. With pkgdown and services like GitHub Pages, deploying a package website is so simple and straightforward that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see it as an essential part of writing a package.

      <description>Over on the Crunch.io dev blog, I wrote about how we used Travis-CI to automate the building of our various static sites. I thought I’d do the same for my personal blog, though with one twist: using R and the blogdown package on top of Hugo.
This blogdown GitHub issue pointed to Yihui’s guide to building bookdown projects on Travis, as well as a project that had adapted that flow for blogdown.</description>
