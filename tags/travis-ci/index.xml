      <description>Over on the Crunch.io dev blog, I wrote about how we used Travis-CI to automate the building of our various static sites. I thought I’d do the same for my personal blog, though with one twist: using R and the blogdown package on top of Hugo.
The thread on this issue in the blogdown repository pointed to Yihui’s guide to building bookdown pages on Travis, as well as a project that had adapted that flow for blogdown.</description>
