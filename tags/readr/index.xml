      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I analyzed some web traffic for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://crunch.io/team&#34;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; at an all-hands meetup. I suspected there were some misconceptions about the frequency of certain kinds of requests, and that some basic descriptive statistics could help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start an analysis like this, I also think about how to make it easier to repeat it. If the question is interesting enough to merit analysis now, it will probably be interesting next month too&amp;mdash;particularly if it reveals things we want to improve. In this particular exercise, not only did I get statistics for my presentation, I also got a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nealrichardson/elbr&#34;&gt;new R package&lt;/a&gt; and some insights into how to read in data stored in lots of text files in an efficient, fast way, using &lt;a href=&#34;http://readr.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
