      <description>Recently I analyzed some web traffic for my team at an all-hands meetup. I suspected there were some misconceptions about the frequency of certain kinds of requests, and that some basic descriptive statistics could help.
Whenever I start an analysis like this, I also think about how to make it easier to repeat it. If the question is interesting enough to merit analysis now, it will probably be interesting next month too&amp;mdash;particularly if it reveals things we want to improve.</description>
