      <description>A rip current is a powerful flow that can drag an unsuspecting swimmer out to sea. When visiting a beach with rip currents, you&amp;rsquo;re told that if you get caught in one, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to swim back toward the beach, against the current&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s too strong. Instead, you should swim parallel to the beach to get out of the current, and then you can get back to shore more easily.</description>
