For contemporary analysis, we sync the last couple of months of load balancer (AWS ELB) log files from S3 to a EC2 instance, and I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href="https://enpiar.com/2018/04/25/turbocharging-readr/">written some tools in R&lt;/a> to query them using &lt;code>dplyr&lt;/code> methods. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/nealrichardson/elbr">&lt;code>elbr&lt;/code>&lt;/a> R package I wrote does some clever things to take advantage of the directory structure for fast filtering by date, and it supports parallelized reading and querying of the files, among other optimizations, so it&amp;rsquo;s reasonably fast. But it assumes that the source files are local.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
