      <title>Writing Docs Is Better Than Having Docs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When interviewing developers at &lt;a href=&#34;https://crunch.io/jobs&#34;&gt;Crunch&lt;/a&gt;, we sometimes do a live coding exercise using a JavaScript data visualization library. It&amp;rsquo;s basic, and we don&amp;rsquo;t assume any prior knowledge of the library. To start, we tell the candidate that they can use the full internet to help them solve the problem (we&amp;rsquo;re trying to simulate real working conditions, after all), and by the way, this library has excellent documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s about 50-50 the candidates that ever open the docs&amp;mdash;the other half go straight to Stack Overflow to look for code to copy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you submit a package update to CRAN, they ask you to check some boxes confirming that you&amp;rsquo;ve done your due diligence on your submission: that it passes its checks. One confirmation is that you&amp;rsquo;ve addressed any failures on the CRAN package check page, which looks &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_httptest.html&#34;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/cran-check-httptest.png&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Hey, all passing today!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This page is a window into one of the key features of CRAN: it runs continuous-integration tests of your package against multiple versions of R, on multiple operating systems, with the current version of your dependencies. You can&amp;rsquo;t (without a special dispensation) submit a package to CRAN that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on all platforms that R supports, and you always have to pass against the bleeding-edge development version.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Integrating &#39;pkgdown&#39; with Your Personal Website</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Publishing a website for your R package is simple with &lt;a href=&#34;http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkgdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://enpiar.com/2017/11/21/getting-down-with-pkgdown/&#34;&gt;As I recently discussed&lt;/a&gt;, you can build a basic site and host it on GitHub Pages with just a handful of commands and clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a great start, but why stop there? If you have a personal website or blog, it would be nice to have your package page mesh with it&amp;mdash;that is, it should fit with your &amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo;. Your personal site has a style (font, color, layout, etc.), and ideally your pkgdown site should match it. If you have a custom domain name for your website, it would be great to serve your pkgdown site under the same domain, rather than the default &lt;code&gt;username.github.io/pkgname&lt;/code&gt; GitHub Pages convention. And if you have more than one R package with a website, they should all have a coherent presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Down with pkgdown</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pkgdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an incredibly powerful tool for building beautiful websites for R packages. With &lt;code&gt;pkgdown&lt;/code&gt; and services like &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, deploying a package website is so simple and straightforward that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see it as an essential part of writing a package. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the act of preparing a package website has led me to improve the package itself, particularly the readability and usefulness of its documentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>One-Hour Package</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://crunch.io/&#34;&gt;Crunch&lt;/a&gt;, I occasionally pick up small &lt;a href=&#34;../../../07/04/better-management-through-code/&#34;&gt;coding projects to help with project management&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, I wanted a way to get automated reporting on our open issues in &lt;a href=&#34;http://usersnap.com/&#34;&gt;Usersnap&lt;/a&gt;, a service embedded in our web application that allows users to report bugs from within the app. My thought was to set up a cron job to report daily summaries in our Slack channel on things like the number of reports created, resolved, and so on, so that we could make sure that bug reports were being addressed quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
