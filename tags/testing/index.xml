      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 3.2.0 release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;httptest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=httptest&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;. This is a minor release with several enhancements suggested by package users. Details can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/news/#httptest-3-2-0&#34;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few of the changes improve the behavior of &lt;code&gt;httptest&lt;/code&gt; in interactive use. There is one new function, &lt;a href=&#34;https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/reference/use_httptest.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;use_httptest()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which configures your package to use &lt;code&gt;httptest&lt;/code&gt; when you&amp;rsquo;re setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who filed issues and submitted pull requests. Included in this release are contributions from and improvements prompted by GitHub users &lt;code&gt;brooklynbagel&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jameslamb&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jjankowiak&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;npelikan&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ramiromagno&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>httptest 2.3.2 Released</title>
      <link>/2017/10/20/httptest-2.3.2-released/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2.3.2 release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/&#34;&gt;httptest&lt;/a&gt; has just been published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=httptest&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;. Since the 2.0.0 release in June, several key additions have been made. See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://enpiar.com/r/httptest/news/&#34;&gt;NEWS&lt;/a&gt; for the full list. If you follow those links, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the first new &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo;: &lt;code&gt;httptest&lt;/code&gt; now has a proper website, using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/&#34;&gt;pkgdown&lt;/a&gt; site generator!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of functionality, the biggest change has been the addition of a framework for &amp;ldquo;redacting&amp;rdquo;, or removing sensitive information like tokens and ids from test fixtures. While most API responses recorded by &lt;code&gt;capture_requests&lt;/code&gt; wouldn&amp;rsquo;t contain your authentication credentials&amp;mdash;the default &amp;ldquo;simplified&amp;rdquo; behavior writes out only the JSON response bodies&amp;mdash;I more than once had to edit files by hand to remove cookies and tokens. I even had to sanitize code pushed to GitHub that contained secret tokens and needed to reset API tokens elsewhere. After watching others struggle with the same issue, it was time to implement a solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>7 Hard Testing Problems Made Easy By httptest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of testing and test automation, both on &lt;a href=&#34;https://crunch.io/dev/&#34;&gt;the team I lead&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nealrichardson&#34;&gt;my own projects&lt;/a&gt;. Tests provide valuable evidence that your code works. Without tests, you&amp;rsquo;re engaging in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/enpiar/status/748082354455969796&#34;&gt;faith-based development&lt;/a&gt;: you believe your code works because you believe in your own infallibility as a coder. Theology aside, as a practical matter, tests are liberating because they allow you to modify and extend your code without fear of breaking existing functionality. Unfortunately, testing code that communicates with remote services can be challenging. Dealing with authentication, bootstrapping server state, cleaning up objects that may get created during the test run, network flakiness, and other complications can make testing seem too costly to bother with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
