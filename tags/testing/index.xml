      <description>The 2.3.2 release of httptest has just been published on CRAN. Since the 2.0.0 release in June, several key additions have been made. See the NEWS for the full list. If you follow those links, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the first new &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo;: httptest now has a proper website, using the pkgdown site generator!
In terms of functionality, the biggest change has been the addition of a framework for &amp;ldquo;redacting&amp;rdquo;, or removing sensitive information like tokens and ids from test fixtures.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of testing and test automation, both on the team I lead and in my own projects. Tests provide valuable evidence that your code works. Without tests, you&amp;rsquo;re engaging in faith-based development: you believe your code works because you believe in your own infallibility as a coder. Theology aside, as a practical matter, tests are liberating because they allow you to modify and extend your code without fear of breaking existing functionality.</description>
