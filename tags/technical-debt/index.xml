      <description>As a product owner and development leader, I often hear that &amp;ldquo;we have to pay our technical debt&amp;rdquo; in order to proceed with our product plan. As the metaphor goes, when you choose to take shortcuts now, you incur a debt that you&amp;rsquo;ll eventually have to repay with interest. The implication when a developer raises it is that those interest payments are too high and are preventing us from moving forward as effectively as we should.</description>
