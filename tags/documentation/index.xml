It&amp;rsquo;s basic, and we don&amp;rsquo;t assume any prior knowledge of the library. To start, we tell the candidate that they can use the full internet to help them solve the problem (we&amp;rsquo;re trying to simulate real working conditions, after all), and by the way, this library has excellent documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s about 50-50 the candidates that ever open the docs&amp;mdash;the other half go straight to Stack Overflow to look for code to copy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integrating 'pkgdown' with Your Personal Website</title><link>/2017/12/18/integrating-pkgdown-with-your-personal-website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2017 16:49:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>/2017/12/18/integrating-pkgdown-with-your-personal-website/</guid><description>&lt;p>Publishing a website for your R package is simple with &lt;a href="http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">&lt;code>pkgdown&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="https://enpiar.com/2017/11/21/getting-down-with-pkgdown/">As I recently discussed&lt;/a>, you can build a basic site and host it on GitHub Pages with just a handful of commands and clicks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a great start, but why stop there? If you have a personal website or blog, it would be nice to have your package page mesh with it&amp;mdash;that is, it should fit with your &amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo;. Your personal site has a style (font, color, layout, etc.), and ideally your pkgdown site should match it. If you have a custom domain name for your website, it would be great to serve your pkgdown site under the same domain, rather than the default &lt;code>username.github.io/pkgname&lt;/code> GitHub Pages convention. And if you have more than one R package with a website, they should all have a coherent presentation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting Down with pkgdown</title><link>/2017/11/21/getting-down-with-pkgdown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2017 16:49:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>/2017/11/21/getting-down-with-pkgdown/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">&lt;code>pkgdown&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is an incredibly powerful tool for building beautiful websites for R packages. With &lt;code>pkgdown&lt;/code> and services like &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages&lt;/a>, deploying a package website is so simple and straightforward that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see it as an essential part of writing a package. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the act of preparing a package website has led me to improve the package itself, particularly the readability and usefulness of its documentation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
