      <title>Writing Docs Is Better Than Having Docs</title>

      <description>When interviewing developers at Crunch, we sometimes do a live coding exercise using a JavaScript data visualization library. It&amp;rsquo;s basic, and we don&amp;rsquo;t assume any prior knowledge of the library. To start, we tell the candidate that they can use the full internet to help them solve the problem (we&amp;rsquo;re trying to simulate real working conditions, after all), and by the way, this library has excellent documentation.
It&amp;rsquo;s about 50-50 the candidates that ever open the docs&amp;mdash;the other half go straight to Stack Overflow to look for code to copy.</description>

      <description>Publishing a website for your R package is simple with pkgdown. As I recently discussed, you can build a basic site and host it on GitHub Pages with just a handful of commands and clicks.
That&amp;rsquo;s a great start, but why stop there? If you have a personal website or blog, it would be nice to have your package page mesh with it&amp;mdash;that is, it should fit with your &amp;ldquo;brand&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Getting Down with pkgdown</title>

      <description>pkgdown is an incredibly powerful tool for building beautiful websites for R packages. With pkgdown and services like GitHub Pages, deploying a package website is so simple and straightforward that I&amp;rsquo;m starting to see it as an essential part of writing a package. What&amp;rsquo;s more, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the act of preparing a package website has led me to improve the package itself, particularly the readability and usefulness of its documentation.</description>
