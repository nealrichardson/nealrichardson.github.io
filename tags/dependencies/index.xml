      <description>At Crunch, we’ve recently hired an “R Team” to build out our package offerings beyond what I could write in my spare time. It’s been great to have more resources to dedicate to our R tools, and it’s been particularly fun for me because now I get to have package design debates with other smart humans, not just inside my head.
In one such debate, we discussed when it was appropriate to add a new dependency to a package.</description>
