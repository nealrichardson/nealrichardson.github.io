(In fact, I linked to one of them in the slides from last week.)

I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do the same for my personal blog, though with one twist: using R and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown&lt;/a> package on top of Hugo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/26">This blogdown GitHub issue&lt;/a> pointed to &lt;a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/github.html">Yihui&amp;rsquo;s guide to building bookdown projects on Travis&lt;/a>, as well as a project that had &lt;a href="https://github.com/curso-r/verao2017">adapted&lt;/a> that flow for &lt;code>blogdown&lt;/code>. Both were helpful, and with my prior experience, I was able to build on those examples to come up with a simple workflow. It was shockingly straightforward.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This Is a Blog</title><link>/2017/05/22/this-is-a-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 21:11:48 -0700</pubDate><guid>/2017/05/22/this-is-a-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page left intentionally blank.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
