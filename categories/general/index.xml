      <description>In putting up the slides for the talk I gave at last week&amp;rsquo;s Bay Area R meetup, I figured it would be good to dig up the slides from previous talks and post them here too. (In fact, I linked to one of them in the slides from last week.) So, there&amp;rsquo;s now a &amp;ldquo;Talks&amp;rdquo; section of the site.</description>

      <title>Building a Blogdown Site with Travis-CI</title>

      <description>Over on the Crunch.io dev blog, I wrote about how we used Travis-CI to automate the building of our various static sites. I thought I’d do the same for my personal blog, though with one twist: using R and the blogdown package on top of Hugo.
This blogdown GitHub issue pointed to Yihui’s guide to building bookdown projects on Travis, as well as a project that had adapted that flow for blogdown.</description>
